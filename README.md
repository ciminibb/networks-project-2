### Challenges
The first major challenge we encountered in this project was getting started! Much of the
complexity, as far as sockets are concerned, came at the beginning of our work. Being
inexperienced socket programmers, we were confused. So, we referenced Project 1. It provided
effective examples for basic socket programming. The result was a framework which we could
build upon. With a client and server communicating, we needed only slight adjustments to
implement a first, basic message board. Those adjustments were informed by further research.
Afterward, we were ready to begin implementing the features spelled out in part 1.
